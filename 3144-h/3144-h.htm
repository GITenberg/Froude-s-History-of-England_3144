<h1>FROUDE&rsquo;S HISTORY OF ENGLAND <a
name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a></h1>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> appeared a few years since a
&lsquo;Comic History of England,&rsquo; duly caricaturing and
falsifying all our great national events, and representing the
English people, for many centuries back, as a mob of fools and
knaves, led by the nose in each generation by a few arch-fools
and arch-knaves.&nbsp; Some thoughtful persons regarded the book
with utter contempt and indignation; it seemed to them a crime to
have written it; a proof of &lsquo;banausia,&rsquo; as Aristotle
would have called it, only to be outdone by the writing a
&lsquo;Comic Bible.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a while, however, their
indignation began to subside; their second thoughts, as usual,
were more charitable than their first; they were not surprised to
hear that the author was an honest, just, and able magistrate;
they saw that the publication of such a book involved no moral
turpitude; that it was merely meant as a jest on a subject on
which jesting was permissible, and as a money speculation in a
field of which men had a right to make money; while all which
seemed offensive in it was merely the outcome, and as it were
apotheosis, of that method of writing English history which has
been popular for nearly a hundred years.&nbsp; &lsquo;Which of
our modern historians,&rsquo; they asked themselves, &lsquo;has
had any real feeling of the importance, the sacredness, of his
subject?&mdash;any real trust in, or respect for, the characters
with whom he dealt?&nbsp; Has not the belief of each and all of
them been the same&mdash;that on the whole, the many always have
been fools and knaves; foolish and knavish enough, at least, to
become the puppets of a few fools and knaves who held the reins
of power?&nbsp; Have they not held that, on the whole, the
problems of human nature and human history have been sufficiently
solved by Gibbon and Voltaire, Gil Blas and Figaro; that our
forefathers were silly barbarians; that this glorious nineteenth
century is the one region of light, and that all before was outer
darkness, peopled by &lsquo;foreign devils,&rsquo; Englishmen, no
doubt, according to the flesh, but in spirit, in knowledge, in
creed, in customs, so utterly different from ourselves that we
shall merely show our sentimentalism by doing aught but laughing
at them?</p>
<p>On what other principle have our English histories as yet been
constructed, even down to the children&rsquo;s books, which
taught us in childhood that the history of this country was
nothing but a string of foolish wars, carried on by wicked kings,
for reasons hitherto unexplained, save on that great historic law
of Goldsmith&rsquo;s by which Sir Archibald Alison would still
explain the French Revolution&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The dog, to serve his private ends,<br />
Went mad, and bit the man?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be answered by some, and perhaps rather angrily, that
these strictures are too sweeping; that there is arising, in a
certain quarter, a school of history books for young people of a
far more reverent tone, which tries to do full honour to the
Church and her work in the world.&nbsp; Those books of this
school which we have seen, we must reply, seem just as much
wanting in real reverence for the past as the school of Gibbon
and Voltaire.&nbsp; It is not the past which they reverence, but
a few characters or facts eclectically picked out of the past,
and, for the most part, made to look beautiful by ignoring all
the features which will not suit their preconceived
pseudo-ideal.&nbsp; There is in these books a scarcely concealed
dissatisfaction with the whole course of the British mind since
the Reformation, and (though they are not inclined to confess the
fact) with its whole course before the Reformation, because that
course was one of steady struggle against the Papacy and its
anti-national pretensions.&nbsp; They are the outcome of an
utterly un-English tone of thought; and the so-called &lsquo;ages
of faith&rsquo; are pleasant and useful to them, principally
because they are distant and unknown enough to enable them to
conceal from their readers that in the ages on which they look
back as ideally perfect a Bernard and a Francis of Assisi were
crying all day long&mdash;&lsquo;O that my head were a fountain
of tears, that I might weep for the sins of my
people!&rsquo;&nbsp; Dante was cursing popes and prelates in the
name of the God of Righteousness; Boccaccio and Chaucer were
lifting the veil from priestly abominations of which we now are
ashamed even to read; and Wolsey, seeing the rottenness of the
whole system, spent his mighty talents, and at last poured out
his soul unto death, in one long useless effort to make the
crooked straight, and number that which had been weighed in the
balances of God, and found for ever wanting.&nbsp; To ignore
wilfully facts like these, which were patent all along to the
British nation, facts on which the British laity acted, till they
finally conquered at the Reformation, and on which they are
acting still, and will, probably, act for ever, is not to have
any real reverence for the opinions or virtues of our
forefathers; and we are not astonished to find repeated, in such
books, the old stock calumnies against our lay and Protestant
worthies, taken at second-hand from the pages of Lingard.&nbsp;
In copying from Lingard, however, this party has done no more
than those writers have who would repudiate any
party&mdash;almost any Christian&mdash;purpose.&nbsp; Lingard is
known to have been a learned man, and to have examined many
manuscripts which few else had taken the trouble to look at; so
his word is to be taken, no one thinking it worth while to ask
whether he has either honestly read or honestly quoted the
documents.&nbsp; It suited the sentimental and lazy liberality of
the last generation to make a show of fairness by letting the
Popish historian tell his side of the story, and to sneer at the
illiberal old notion that gentlemen of his class were given to be
rather careless about historic truth when they had a purpose to
serve thereby; and Lingard is now actually recommended as a
standard authority for the young by educated Protestants, who
seem utterly unable to see that, whether the man be honest or
not, his whole view of the course of British events since Becket
first quarrelled with his king must be antipodal to their own;
and that his account of all which has passed for three hundred
years since the fall of Wolsey is most likely to be (and, indeed,
may be proved to be) one huge libel on the whole nation, and the
destiny which God has marked out for it.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, no intrinsic cause why the ecclesiastical,
or pseudo-Catholic, view of history should, in any wise, conduce
to a just appreciation of our forefathers.&nbsp; For not only did
our forefathers rebel against that conception again and again,
till they finally trampled it under their feet, and so appear,
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i>, as offenders to be judged at its bar;
but the conception itself is one which takes the very same view
of nature as that cynic conception of which we spoke above.&nbsp;
Man, with the Romish divines, is, <i>ipso facto</i>, the same
being as the man of Voltaire, Le Sage, or Beaumarchais; he is an
insane and degraded being, who is to be kept in order, and, as
far as may be, cured and set to work by an ecclesiastical system;
and the only threads of light in the dark web of his history are
clerical and theurgic, not lay and human.&nbsp; Voltaire is the
very <i>experimentum crucis</i> of this ugly fact.&nbsp; European
history looks to him what it would have looked to his Jesuit
preceptors, had the sacerdotal element in it been wanting; what
heathen history actually did look to them.&nbsp; He eliminates
the sacerdotal element, and nothing remains but the chaos of apes
and wolves which the Jesuits had taught him to believe was the
original substratum of society.&nbsp; The humanity of his
history&mdash;even of his &lsquo;Pucelle
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans&rsquo;,&mdash;is simply the humanity of
Sanchez and the rest of those <i>vingtquatre P&egrave;res</i> who
hang gibbeted for ever in the pages of Pascal.&nbsp; He is
superior to his teachers, certainly, in this, that he has hope
for humanity on earth; dreams of a new and nobler life for
society, by means of a true and scientific knowledge of the laws
of the moral and material universe; in a word, he has, in the
midst of all his filth and his atheism, a faith in a righteous
and truth-revealing God, which the priests who brought him up had
not.&nbsp; Let the truth be spoken, even though in favour of such
a destroying Azrael as Voltaire.&nbsp; And what if his primary
conception of humanity be utterly base?&nbsp; Is that of our
modern historians so much higher?&nbsp; Do Christian men seem to
them, on the whole, in all ages, to have had the spirit of God
with them, leading them into truth, however imperfectly and
confusedly they may have learnt his lessons?&nbsp; Have they ever
heard with their ears, or listened when their fathers have
declared unto them, the noble works which God did in their days,
and in the old time before them?&nbsp; Do they believe that the
path of Christendom has been, on the whole, the path of life and
the right way, and that the living God is leading her
therein?&nbsp; Are they proud of the old British worthies?&nbsp;
Are they jealous and tender of the reputation of their
ancestors?&nbsp; Do they believe that there were any worthies at
all in England before the steam-engine and political economy were
discovered?&nbsp; Do their conceptions of past society and the
past generations retain anything of that great thought which is
common to all the Aryan races&mdash;that is, to all races who
have left aught behind them better than mere mounds of
earth&mdash;to Hindoo and Persian, Greek and Roman, Teuton and
Scandinavian, that men are the sons of the heroes, who were the
sons of God?&nbsp; Or do they believe that for civilised people
of the nineteenth century it is as well to say as little as
possible about ancestors who possessed our vices without our
amenities, our ignorance without our science; who were bred, no
matter how, like flies by summer heat, out of that everlasting
midden which men call the world, to buzz and sting their foolish
day, and leave behind them a fresh race which knows them not, and
could win no honour by owning them, and which owes them no more
than if it had been produced, as midden-flies were said to be of
old, by some spontaneous generation?</p>
<p>It is not probable that this writer will be likely to
undervalue political economy, or the steam-engine, or any other
solid and practical good which God has unveiled to this
generation.&nbsp; All that he does demand (for he has a right to
demand it) is that rational men should believe that our
forefathers were at least as good as we are; that whatsoever
their measure of light was, they acted up to what they knew as
faithfully as we do; and that, on the whole, it was not their
fault if they did not know more.&nbsp; Even now the real
discoveries of the age are made, as of old, by a very few men;
and, when made, have to struggle, as of old, against all manner
of superstitions, lazinesses, scepticisms.&nbsp; Is the history
of the Mini&eacute; rifle one so very complimentary to our
age&rsquo;s quickness of perception that we can afford to throw
many stones at the prejudices of our ancestors?&nbsp; The truth
is that, as of old, &lsquo;many men talk of Robin Hood who never
shot in his bow&rsquo;; and many talk of Bacon who never
discovered a law by induction since they were born.&nbsp; As far
as our experience goes, those who are loudest in their
jubilations over the wonderful progress of the age are those who
have never helped that progress forward one inch, but find it a
great deal easier and more profitable to use the results which
humbler men have painfully worked out as second-hand capital for
hustings-speeches and railway books, and flatter a
mechanics&rsquo; institute of self-satisfied youths by telling
them that the least instructed of them is wiser than Erigena or
Roger Bacon.&nbsp; Let them be.&nbsp; They have their
reward.&nbsp; And so also has the patient and humble man of
science, who, the more he knows, confesses the more how little he
knows, and looks back with affectionate reverence on the great
men of old time&mdash;on Archimedes and Ptolemy, Aristotle and
Pliny, and many another honourable man who, walking in great
darkness, sought a ray of light, and did not seek in
vain,&mdash;as integral parts of that golden chain of which he is
but one link more; as scientific forefathers, without whose aid
his science could not have had a being.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this general tone of irreverence for our
forefathers is no hopeful sign.&nbsp; It is unwise to
&lsquo;inquire why the former times were better than
these&rsquo;; to hang lazily and weakly over some eclectic dream
of a past golden age; for to do so is to deny that God is working
in this age, as well as in past ages; that His light is as near
us now as it was to the worthies of old time.</p>
<p>But it is more than unwise to boast and rejoice that the
former times were worse than these; and to teach young people to
say in their hearts, &lsquo;What clever fellows we are, compared
with our stupid old fogies of fathers!&rsquo;&nbsp; More than
unwise; for possibly it may be false in fact.&nbsp; To look at
the political and moral state of Europe at this moment,
Christendom can hardly afford to look down on any preceding
century, and seems to be in want of something which neither
science nor constitutional government seems able to supply.&nbsp;
Whether our forefathers also lacked that something we will not
inquire just now; but if they did, their want of scientific and
political knowledge was evidently not the cause of the defect; or
why is not Spain now infinitely better, instead of being
infinitely worse off, than she was three hundred years ago?</p>
<p>At home, too&mdash;But on the question whether we are so very
much better off than our forefathers Mr. Froude, not we, must
speak: for he has deliberately, in his new history, set himself
to the solution of this question, and we will not anticipate what
he has to say; what we would rather insist on now are the moral
effects produced on our young people by books which teach them to
look with contempt on all generations but their own, and with
suspicion on all public characters save a few contemporaries of
their own especial party.</p>
<p>There is an ancient Hebrew book, which contains a singular
story concerning a grandson who was cursed because his father
laughed at the frailty of the grandfather.&nbsp; Whether the
reader shall regard that story (as we do) as a literal fact
recorded by inspired wisdom, as an instance of one of the great
root-laws of family life, and therefore of that national life
which (as the Hebrew book so cunningly shows) is the organic
development of the family life; or whether he shall treat it (as
we do not) as a mere apologue or myth, he must confess that it is
equally grand in its simplicity and singular in its unexpected
result.&nbsp; The words of the story, taken literally and simply,
no more justify the notion that Canaan&rsquo;s slavery was any
magical consequence of the old patriarch&rsquo;s anger than they
do the well-known theory that it was the cause of the
Negro&rsquo;s blackness.&nbsp; Ham shows a low, foul, irreverent,
unnatural temper towards his father.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s
shame is not a cause of shame to his son, but only of
laughter.&nbsp; Noah prophesies (in the fullest and deepest
meaning of that word) that a curse will come upon that
son&rsquo;s son; that he will be a slave of slaves; and reason
and experience show that he spoke truth.&nbsp; Let the young but
see that their fathers have no reverence for the generation
before them, then will they in turn have no reverence for their
fathers.&nbsp; Let them be taught that the sins of their
ancestors involve their own honour so little that they need not
take any trouble to clear the blot off the scutcheon, but may
safely sit down and laugh over it, saying, &lsquo;Very likely it
is true.&nbsp; If so, it is very amusing; and if not&mdash;what
matter?&rsquo;&mdash;Then those young people are being bred up in
a habit of mind which contains in itself all the capabilities of
degradation and slavery, in self-conceit, hasty assertion,
disbelief in nobleness, and all the other &lsquo;credulities of
scepticism&rsquo;: parted from that past from which they take
their common origin, they are parted also from each other, and
become selfish, self-seeking, divided, and therefore weak:
disbelieving in the nobleness of those who have gone before them,
they learn more and more to disbelieve in the nobleness of those
around them; and, by denying God&rsquo;s works of old, come, by a
just and dreadful Nemesis, to be unable to see his works in the
men of their own day; to suspect and impugn valour,
righteousness, disinterestedness in their contemporaries; to
attribute low motives; to pride themselves on looking at men and
things as &lsquo;men who know the world,&rsquo; so the young
puppies style it; to be less and less chivalrous to women, less
and less respectful to old men, less and less ashamed of boasting
about their sensual appetites; in a word, to show all those
symptoms which, when fully developed, leave a generation without
fixed principles, without strong faith, without self-restraint,
without moral cohesion, the sensual and divided prey of any race,
however inferior in scientific knowledge, which has a clear and
fixed notion of its work and destiny.&nbsp; That many of these
signs are themselves more and more ominously showing in our young
men, from the fine gentleman who rides in Rotten Row to the
boy-mechanic who listens enraptured to Mr. Holyoake&rsquo;s
exposures of the absurdity of all human things save Mr.
Holyoake&rsquo;s self, is a fact which presses itself most on
those who have watched this age most carefully, and who (rightly
or wrongly) attribute much of this miserable temper to the way in
which history has been written among us for the last hundred
years.</p>
<p>Whether or not Mr. Froude would agree with these notions, he
is more or less responsible for them; for they have been
suggested by his &lsquo;History of England from the Fall of
Wolsey to the Death of Elizabeth.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was impossible
to read the book without feeling the contrast between its tone
and that of every other account of the times which one had ever
seen.&nbsp; Mr. Froude seems to have set to work upon the
principle, too much ignored in judging of the past, that the
historian&rsquo;s success must depend on his dramatic faculty;
and not merely on that constructive element of the faculty in
which Mr. Macaulay shows such astonishing power, but on that
higher and deeper critical element which ought to precede the
constructive process, and without which the constructive element
will merely enable a writer, as was once bitterly but truly said,
&lsquo;to produce the greatest possible misrepresentation with
the least possible distortion of fact.&rsquo;&nbsp; That deeper
dramatic faculty, the critical, is not logical merely, but moral,
and depends on the moral health, the wideness and heartiness of
his moral sympathies, by which he can put himself&mdash;as Mr.
Froude has attempted to do, and as we think
successfully&mdash;into the place of each and every character,
and not merely feel for them, but feel with them.&nbsp; He does
not merely describe their actions from the outside, attributing
them arbitrarily to motives which are pretty sure to be the
lowest possible, because it is easier to conceive a low motive
than a lofty one, and to call a man a villain than to unravel
patiently the tangled web of good and evil of which his thoughts
are composed.&nbsp; He has attempted to conceive of his
characters as he would if they had been his own contemporaries
and equals, acting, speaking in his company; and he has therefore
thought himself bound to act toward them by those rules of
charity and courtesy, common alike to Christian morals, English
law, and decent society; namely, to hold every man innocent till
he is proved guilty; where a doubt exists, to give the prisoner
at the bar the benefit of it; not to excite the minds of the
public against him by those insinuative or vituperative epithets,
which are but adders and scorpions; and, on the whole, to believe
that a man&rsquo;s death and burial is not the least reason for
ceasing to behave to him like a gentleman and a Christian.&nbsp;
We are not inclined to play with solemn things, or to copy Lucian
and Quevedo in writing dialogues of the dead; but what dialogues
might some bold pen dash off between the old sons of Anak, at
whose coming Hades has long ago been moved, and to receive whom
all the kings of the nation have risen up, and the little
scribblers who have fancied themselves able to fathom and
describe characters to whom they were but pigmies!&nbsp; Conceive
a half-hour&rsquo;s interview between Queen Elizabeth and some
popular lady-scribbler, who has been deluding herself into the
fancy that gossiping inventories of millinery are history . . .
&lsquo;You pretend to judge me, whose labours, whose cares, whose
fiery trials were, beside yours, as the heaving volcano beside a
boy&rsquo;s firework?&nbsp; You condemn my weaknesses?&nbsp; Know
that they were stronger than your strength!&nbsp; You impute
motives for my sins?&nbsp; Know that till you are as great as I
have been, for evil and for good, you will be as little able to
comprehend my sins as my righteousness!&nbsp; Poor marsh-croaker,
who wishest not merely to swell up to the bulk of the ox, but to
embrace it in thy little paws, know thine own size, and leave me
to be judged by Him who made me!&rsquo; . . . How the poor soul
would shrink back into nothing before that lion eye which saw and
guided the destinies of the world, and all the flunkey-nature (if
such a vice exist beyond the grave) come out in utter abjectness,
as if the ass in the fable, on making his kick at the dead lion,
had discovered to his horror that the lion was alive and
well&mdash;Spirit of Quevedo! finish for us the picture which we
cannot finish for ourselves.</p>
<p>In a very different spirit from such has Mr. Froude approached
these times.&nbsp; Great and good deeds were done in them; and it
has therefore seemed probable to him that there were great and
good men there to do them.&nbsp; Thoroughly awake to the fact
that the Reformation was the new birth of the British nation, it
has seemed to him a puzzling theory which attributes its success
to the lust of a tyrant and the cupidity of his courtiers.&nbsp;
It has evidently seemed to him paradoxical that a king who was
reputed to have been a satyr, instead of keeping as many
concubines as seemed good to him, should have chosen to gratify
his passions by entering six times into the strict bonds of
matrimony, religiously observing those bonds.&nbsp; It has seemed
to him even more paradoxical that one reputed to have been the
most sanguinary tyrant who ever disgraced the English throne
should have been not only endured, but loved and regretted by a
fierce and free-spoken people; and he, we suppose, could
comprehend as little as we can the reasoning of such a passage as
the following, especially when it proceeds from the pen of so
wise and venerable a writer as Mr. Hallam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A government administered with so frequent violations,
not only of the chartered privileges of Englishmen, but of those
still more sacred rights which natural law has established, must
have been regarded, one would imagine, with just abhorrence and
earnest longings for a change.&nbsp; Yet contemporary authorities
by no means answer this expectation.&nbsp; Some mention Henry
after his death in language of eulogy;&rsquo; (not only
Elizabeth, be it remembered, but Cromwell also, always spoke of
him with deepest respect; and their language always found an echo
in the English heart;) &lsquo;and if we except those whom
attachment to the ancient religion had inspired with hatred to
his memory, few seem to have been aware that his name would
descend to posterity among those of the many tyrants and
oppressors of innocence whom the wrath of Heaven has raised up,
and the servility of man endured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The names of even those few we should be glad to have; for it
seems to us that, with the exception of a few ultra-Protestants,
who could not forgive that persecution of the Reformers which he
certainly permitted, if not encouraged, during one period of his
reign, no one adopted the modern view of his character till more
than a hundred years after his death, when belief in all
nobleness and faith had died out among an ignoble and faithless
generation, and the scandalous gossip of such a light rogue as
Osborne was taken into the place of honest and respectful
history.</p>
<p>To clear up such seeming paradoxes as these by carefully
examining the facts of the sixteenth century has been Mr.
Froude&rsquo;s work; and we have the results of his labour in two
volumes, embracing only a period of eleven years; but giving
promise that the mysteries of the succeeding time will be well
cleared up for us in future volumes, and that we shall find our
forefathers to have been, if no better, at least no worse men
than ourselves.&nbsp; He has brought to the task known talents
and learning, a mastery over English prose almost unequalled in
this generation, a spirit of most patient and good-tempered
research, and that intimate knowledge of human motives and
passions which his former books have shown, and which we have a
right to expect from any scholar who has really profited by
Aristotle&rsquo;s unrivalled Ethics.&nbsp; He has fairly examined
every contemporary document within his reach, and, as he informs
us in the preface, he has been enabled, through the kindness of
Sir Francis Palgrave, to consult a great number of MSS. relating
to the Reformation, hitherto all but unknown to the public, and
referred to in his work as MSS. in the Rolls&rsquo; House, where
the originals are easily accessible.&nbsp; These, he states, he
intends to publish, with additions from his own reading, as soon
as he has brought his history down to the end of Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>But Mr. Froude&rsquo;s chief text-book seems to have been
State Papers and Acts of Parliament.&nbsp; He has begun his work
in the only temper in which a man can write accurately and well;
in a temper of trust toward the generation whom he
describes.&nbsp; The only temper; for if a man has no affection
for the characters of whom he reads, he will never understand
them; if he has no respect for his subject, he will never take
the trouble to exhaust it.&nbsp; To such an author the Statutes
at large, as the deliberate expression of the nation&rsquo;s will
and conscience, will appear the most important of all sources of
information; the first to be consulted, the last to be
contradicted; the Canon which is not to be checked and corrected
by private letters and flying pamphlets, but which is to check
and correct them.&nbsp; This seems Mr. Froude&rsquo;s theory; and
we are at no pains to confess that if he be wrong we see no hope
of arriving at truth.&nbsp; If these public documents are not to
be admitted in evidence before all others, we see no hope for the
faithful and earnest historian; he must give himself up to swim
as he may on the frothy stream of private letters, anecdotes, and
pamphlets, the puppet of the ignorance, credulity, peevishness,
spite, of any and every gossip and scribbler.</p>
<p>Beginning his history with the fall of Wolsey, Mr. Froude
enters, of course, at his first step into the vexed question of
Henry&rsquo;s divorce: an introductory chapter, on the general
state of England, we shall notice hereafter.</p>
<p>A very short inspection of the method in which he handles the
divorce question gives us at once confidence in his temper and
judgment, and hope that we may at last come to some clearer
understanding of it than the old law gives us, which we have
already quoted, concerning the dog who went mad to serve his
private ends.&nbsp; In a few masterly pages he sketches for us
the rotting and dying Church, which had recovered her power after
the Wars of the Roses over an exhausted nation; but in form only,
not in life.&nbsp; Wolsey, with whom he has fair and
understanding sympathy, he sketches as the transition minister,
&lsquo;loving England well, but loving Rome better,&rsquo; who
intends a reform of the Church, but who, as the Pope&rsquo;s
commissioner for that very purpose, is liable to a
<i>pr&aelig;munire</i>, and therefore dare not appeal to
Parliament to carry out his designs, even if he could have
counted on the Parliament&rsquo;s assistance in any measures
designed to invigorate the Church.&nbsp; At last arises in the
divorce question the accident which brings to an issue on its
most vital point the question of Papal power in England, and
which finally draws down ruin upon Wolsey himself.</p>
<p>This appears to have begun in the winter of
1526&ndash;27.&nbsp; It was proposed to marry the Princess Mary
to a son of the French king.&nbsp; The Bishop of Tarb&eacute;s,
who conducted the negotiations, advised himself, apparently by
special instigation of the evil spirit, to raise a question as to
her legitimacy.</p>
<p>No more ingenious plan for convulsing England could have been
devised.&nbsp; The marriage from which Mary sprang only stood on
a reluctant and doubtful dispensation of the Pope&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Henry had entered into it at the entreaty of his ministers,
contrary to a solemn promise given to his father, and in spite of
the remonstrances of the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; No
blessing seemed to have rested on it.&nbsp; All his children had
died young, save this one sickly girl: a sure note of divine
displeasure in the eyes of that coarse-minded Church which has
always declared the chief, if not the only, purpose of marriage
to be the procreation of children.</p>
<p>But more: to question Mary&rsquo;s legitimacy was to throw
open the question of succession to half a dozen ambitious
competitors.&nbsp; It was, too probably, to involve England at
Henry&rsquo;s death in another civil war of the Roses, and in all
the internecine horrors which were still rankling in the memories
of men; and probably, also, to bring down a French or Scotch
invasion.&nbsp; There was then too good reason, as Mr. Froude
shows at length, for Wolsey&rsquo;s assertion to John
Cassalis&mdash;&lsquo;If his Holiness, which God forbid, shall
show himself unwilling to listen to the King&rsquo;s demands, to
me assuredly it will be but grief to live longer, for the
innumerable evils which I foresee will follow . . . Nothing
before us but universal and inevitable ruin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Too
good reason there was for the confession of the Pope himself to
Gardner, &lsquo;What danger it was to the realm to have this
thing hang in suspense . . . That without an heir-male, etc., the
realm was like to come to dissolution.&rsquo;&nbsp; Too good
reason for the bold assertion of the Cardinal-Governor of
Bologna, that &lsquo;he knew the guise of England as few men did,
and that if the King should die without heirs-male, he was sure
that it would cost two hundred thousand men&rsquo;s lives; and
that to avoid this mischief by a second marriage, he thought,
would deserve heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Too good reason for the
assertion of Hall, that &lsquo;all indifferent and discreet
persons judged it necessary for the Pope to grant Henry a
divorce, and, by enabling him to marry again, give him the hope
of an undisputed heir-male.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Pope had full power
to do this; in fact, such cases had been for centuries integral
parts of his jurisdiction as head of Christendom.&nbsp; But he
was at once too timid and too time-serving to exercise his
acknowledged authority; and thus, just at the very moment when
his spiritual power was being tried in the balance, he chose
himself to expose his political power to the same test.&nbsp;
Both were equally found wanting.&nbsp; He had, it appeared, as
little heart to do justice among kings and princes as he had to
seek and to save the souls of men; and the Reformation followed
as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Through the tangled brakes of this divorce question Mr. Froude
leads us with ease and grace, throwing light, and even beauty,
into dark nooks where before all was mist, not merely by his
intimate acquaintance with the facts, but still more by his deep
knowledge of human character, and of woman&rsquo;s even more than
of man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For the first time the actors in this long
tragedy appear to us as no mere bodiless and soulless names, but
as beings of like passions with ourselves, comprehensible,
coherent, organic, even in their inconsistencies.&nbsp; Catherine
of Arragon is still the Catherine of Shakspeare; but Mr. Froude
has given us the key to many parts of her story which Shakspeare
left unexplained, and delicately enough has made us understand
how Henry&rsquo;s affections, if he ever had any for
her&mdash;faithfully as he had kept (with one exception) to that
loveless <i>mariage de convenance</i>&mdash;may have been
gradually replaced by indifference and even dislike, long before
the divorce was forced on him as a question not only of duty to
the nation, but of duty to Heaven.&nbsp; And that he did see it
in this latter light, Mr. Froude brings proof from his own words,
from which we can escape only by believing that the confessedly
honest &lsquo;Bluff King Hal&rsquo; had suddenly become a
consummate liar and a canting hypocrite.</p>
<p>Delicately, too, as if speaking of a lady whom he had met in
modern society (as a gentleman is bound to do), does Mr. Froude
touch on the sins of that hapless woman, who played for
Henry&rsquo;s crown, and paid for it with her life.&nbsp; With
all mercy and courtesy he gives us proof (for he thinks it his
duty to do so) of the French mis-education, the petty cunning,
the tendency to sensuality, the wilful indelicacy of her position
in Henry&rsquo;s household as the rival of his queen, which made
her last catastrophe at least possible.&nbsp; Of the justice of
her sentence he has no doubt, any more than of her pre-engagement
to some one, as proved by a letter existing among
Cromwell&rsquo;s papers.&nbsp; Poor thing!&nbsp; If she did that
which was laid to her charge, and more, she did nothing, after
all, but what she had been in the habit of seeing the queens and
princesses of the French court do notoriously, and laugh over
shamelessly; while, as Mr. Froude well says, &lsquo;If we are to
hold her entirely free from guilt, we place not only the King,
but the Privy Council, the Judges, the Lords and Commons, and the
two Houses of Convocation, in a position fatal to their honour
and degrading to ordinary humanity&rsquo; (Mr. Froude should have
added Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and her
father, who were on the commission appointed to try her lovers,
and her cousin, Anthony St. Leger, a man of the very highest
character and ability, who was on the jury which found a true
bill against her).&nbsp; &lsquo;We can not,&rsquo; continues Mr.
Froude, &lsquo;acquiesce without inquiry in so painful a
conclusion.&nbsp; The English nation also, as well as she,
deserves justice at our hands; and it cannot be thought
uncharitable if we look with some scrutiny at the career of a
person who, but for the catastrophe with which it closed, would
not have so readily obtained forgiveness for having admitted the
addresses of the King, or for having received the homage of the
court as its future sovereign, while the King&rsquo;s wife, her
mistress, as yet resided under the same roof.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Froude&rsquo;s conclusion is, after examining the facts, the same
with the whole nation of England in Henry&rsquo;s reign: but no
one can accuse him of want of sympathy with the unhappy woman,
who reads the eloquent and affecting account of her trial and
death, which ends his second volume.&nbsp; Our only fear is, that
by having thus told the truth he has, instead of justifying our
ancestors, only added one more to the list of people who are to
be &lsquo;given up&rsquo; with a cynical shrug and smile.&nbsp;
We have heard already, and among young ladies too, who can be as
cynical as other people in these times, such speeches as,
&lsquo;Well, I suppose he has proved Anne Boleyn to be a bad
creature; but that does not make that horrid Henry any more right
in cutting off her head.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus two people will be
despised where only one was before, and the fact still ignored,
that it is just as senseless to say that Henry cut off Anne
Boleyn&rsquo;s head as that Queen Victoria hanged Palmer.&nbsp;
Death, and death of a far more horrible kind than that which Anne
Boleyn suffered, was the established penalty of the offences of
which she was convicted: and which had in her case this fearful
aggravation, that they were offences not against Henry merely,
but against the whole English nation.&nbsp; She had been married
in order that there might be an undisputed heir to the throne,
and a fearful war avoided.&nbsp; To throw into dispute, by any
conduct of hers, the legitimacy of her own offspring, argued a
levity or a hard-heartedness which of itself deserved the
severest punishment.</p>
<p>We will pass from this disagreeable topic to Mr.
Froude&rsquo;s lifelike sketch of Pope Clement, and the endless
tracasseries into which his mingled weakness and cunning led him,
and which, like most crooked dealings, ended by defeating their
own object.&nbsp; Pages 125 <i>et sqq.</i> of Vol. I. contain
sketches of him, his thoughts and ways, as amusing as they are
historically important; but we have no space to quote from
them.&nbsp; It will be well for those to whom the Reformation is
still a matter of astonishment to read those pages, and consider
what manner of man he was, in spite of all pretended divine
authority, under whose rule the Romish system received its
irrecoverable wound.</p>
<p>But of all these figures, not excepting Henry&rsquo;s own,
Wolsey stands out as the most grand and tragical; and Mr. Froude
has done good service to history, if only in making us understand
at last the wondrous &lsquo;butcher&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Shakspeare seems to have felt (though he could explain the reason
neither to his auditors nor, perhaps, to himself) that Wolsey
was, on the whole, an heroical man.&nbsp; Mr. Froude shows at
once his strength and his weakness; his deep sense of the
rottenness of the Church; his purpose to purge her from those
abominations which were as well known, it seems, to him as they
were afterwards to the whole people of England; his vast schemes
for education; his still vaster schemes for breaking the alliance
with Spain, and uniting France and England as fellow-servants of
the Pope, and twin-pillars of the sacred fabric of the Church,
which helped so much toward his interest in Catherine&rsquo;s
divorce, as a &lsquo;means&rsquo; (these are his own words)
&lsquo;to bind my most excellent sovereign and this glorious
realm to the holy Roman See in faith and obedience for
ever&rsquo;; his hopes of deposing the Emperor, putting down the
German heresies, and driving back the Turks beyond the pale of
Christendom; his pathetic confession to the Bishop of Bayonne
that &lsquo;if he could only see the divorce arranged, the King
re-married, the succession settled, and the laws and the Church
reformed, he would retire from the world, and would serve God the
remainder of his days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peace be with him!&nbsp; He was surely a noble soul; misled,
it may be&mdash;as who is not when his turn comes?&mdash;by the
pride of conscious power; and &lsquo;though he loved England
well, yet loving Rome better&rsquo;: but still it is a comfort to
see, either in past or in present, one more brother whom we need
not despise, even though he may have wasted his energies on a
dream.</p>
<p>And on a dream he did waste them, in spite of all his
cunning.&nbsp; As Mr. Froude, in a noble passage,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Extravagant as his hopes seem, the prospect
of realising them was, humanly speaking, neither chimerical nor
even improbable.&nbsp; He had but made the common mistake of men
of the world, who are the representatives of an old order of
things, when that order is doomed and dying.&nbsp; He could not
read the signs of the times; and confounding the barrenness of
death with the barrenness of winter, which might be followed by a
new spring and summer, he believed that the old life-tree of
Catholicism, which in fact was but cumbering the ground, might
bloom again in its old beauty.&nbsp; The thing which he called
heresy was the fire of Almighty God, which no politic
congregation of princes, no state machinery, though it were never
so active, could trample out; and as, in the early years of
Christianity, the meanest slave who was thrown to the wild beasts
for his presence at the forbidden mysteries of the Gospel saw
deeper, in the divine power of his faith, into the future even of
this earthly world, than the sagest of his imperial
persecutors,&mdash;so a truer political prophet than Wolsey would
have been found in the most ignorant of those poor men for whom
his police were searching in the purlieus of London, who were
risking death and torture in disseminating the pernicious volumes
of the English Testament.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen from this magnificent passage that Mr. Froude
is distinctly a Protestant.&nbsp; He is one, to judge from his
book; and all the better one, because he can sympathise with
whatsoever nobleness, even with whatsoever mere conservatism,
existed in the Catholic party.&nbsp; And therefore, because he
has sympathies which are not merely party ones, but human ones,
he has given the world, in these two volumes, a history of the
early Reformation altogether unequalled.&nbsp; This human
sympathy, while it has enabled him to embalm in most affecting
prose the sad story of the noble though mistaken Carthusians, and
to make even the Nun of Kent interesting, because truly womanly,
in her very folly and deceit, has enabled him likewise to show us
the hearts of the early martyrs as they never have been shown
before.&nbsp; His sketch of the Christian Brothers, and his
little true romance of Anthony Dalaber, the Oxford student, are
gems of writing; while his conception of Latimer, on whom he
looks as the hero of the movement, and all but an English Luther,
is as worthy of Latimer as it is of himself.&nbsp; It is written
as history should be, discriminatingly, patiently, and yet
lovingly and genially; rejoicing not in evil, but in the truth;
and rejoicing still more in goodness, where goodness can honestly
be found.</p>
<p>To the ecclesiastical and political elements in the English
Reformation Mr. Froude devotes a large portion of his book.&nbsp;
We shall not enter into the questions which he discusses
therein.&nbsp; That aspect of the movement is a foreign and a
delicate subject, from discussing which a Scotch periodical may
be excused. <a name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a>&nbsp; North Britain had a somewhat
different problem to solve from her southern sister, and solved
it in an altogether different way: but this we must say, that the
facts and, still more, the State Papers (especially the petition
of the Commons, as contrasted with the utterly benighted answer
of the Bishops) which Mr. Froude gives are such as to raise our
opinion of the method on which the English part of the
Reformation was conducted, and make us believe that in this, as
in other matters, both Henry and his Parliament, though still
doctrinal Romanists, were sound-headed practical Englishmen.</p>
<p>This result is of the same kind as most of those at which Mr.
Froude arrives.&nbsp; They form altogether a general
justification of our ancestors in Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s time,
if not of Henry the Eighth himself, which frees Mr. Froude from
that charge of irreverence to the past generations against which
we protested in the beginning of the article.&nbsp; We hope
honestly that he may be as successful in his next volumes as he
has been in these, in vindicating the worthies of the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; Whether he shall fail or not, and whether or not
he has altogether succeeded, in the volumes before us, his book
marks a new epoch, and, we trust, a healthier and loftier one, in
English history.&nbsp; We trust that they inaugurate a time in
which the deeds of our forefathers shall be looked on as sacred
heirlooms; their sins as our shame, their victories as bequests
to us; when men shall have sufficient confidence in those to whom
they owe their existence to scrutinise faithfully and patiently
every fact concerning them, with a proud trust that, search as
they may, they will not find much of which to be ashamed.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. Froude takes a view of Henry&rsquo;s character,
not, indeed, new (for it is the original one), but obsolete for
now two hundred years.&nbsp; Let it be well understood that he
makes no attempt (he has been accused thereof) to whitewash
Henry: all that he does is to remove as far as he can the modern
layers of &lsquo;black-wash,&rsquo; and to let the man himself,
fair or foul, be seen.&nbsp; For the result he is not
responsible: it depends on facts; and unless Mr. Froude has
knowingly concealed facts to an amount of which even a Lingard
might be ashamed, the result is that Henry the Eighth was
actually very much the man which he appeared to be to the English
nation in his own generation, and for two or three generations
after his death&mdash;a result which need not astonish us, if we
will only give our ancestors credit for having at least as much
common sense as ourselves, and believe (why should we not?) that,
on the whole, they understood their own business better than we
are likely to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bloated tyrant,&rsquo; it is confessed, contrived
somehow or other to be popular enough.&nbsp; Mr. Froude tells us
the reasons.&nbsp; He was not born a bloated tyrant, any more
than Queen Elizabeth (though the fact is not generally known) was
born a wizened old woman.&nbsp; He was from youth, till he was
long past his grand climacteric, a very handsome, powerful, and
active man, temperate in his habits, good-humoured, frank and
honest in his speech (as even his enemies are forced to
confess).&nbsp; He seems to have been (as his portraits prove
sufficiently), for good and for evil, a thorough John Bull; a
thorough Englishman: but one of the very highest type.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Had he died (says Mr. Froude) previous to
the first agitation of the divorce, his loss would have been
deplored as one of the heaviest misfortunes which had ever
befallen this country, and he would have left a name which would
have taken its place in history by the side of the Black Prince
or the Conqueror of Agincourt.&nbsp; Left at the most trying age,
with his character unformed, with the means of gratifying every
inclination, and married by his ministers, when a boy, to an
unattractive woman far his senior, he had lived for thirty-six
years almost without blame, and bore through England the
reputation of an upright and virtuous king.&nbsp; Nature had been
prodigal to him of her rarest gifts . . . Of his intellectual
ability we are not left to judge from the suspicious panegyrics
of his contemporaries.&nbsp; His State Papers and letters may be
placed by the side of those of Wolsey or of Cromwell, and they
lose nothing by the comparison.&nbsp; Though they are broadly
different, the perception is equally clear, the expression
equally powerful; and they breathe throughout an irresistible
vigour of purpose.&nbsp; In addition to this, he had a fine
musical taste, carefully cultivated; he spoke and wrote in four
languages; and his knowledge of a multitude of subjects, with
which his versatile ability made him conversant, would have
formed the reputation of any ordinary man.&nbsp; He was among the
best physicians of his age.&nbsp; He was his own engineer,
inventing improvements in artillery and new constructions in
shipbuilding; and this not with the condescending incapacity of a
royal amateur, but with thorough workmanlike understanding.&nbsp;
His reading was vast, especially in theology.&nbsp; He was
&lsquo;attentive,&rsquo; as it is called, &lsquo;to his religious
duties,&rsquo; being present at the services in chapel two or
three times a day with unfailing regularity, and showing, to
outward appearance, a real sense of religious obligation in the
energy and purity of his life.&nbsp; In private he was
good-humoured and good-natured.&nbsp; His letters to his
secretaries, though never undignified, are simple, easy, and
unrestrained, and the letters written by them to him are
similarly plain and business-like, as if the writers knew that
the person whom they were addressing disliked compliments, and
chose to be treated as a man.&nbsp; He seems to have been always
kind, always considerate; inquiring into their private concerns
with genuine interest, and winning, as a consequence, their
sincere and unaffected attachment.&nbsp; As a ruler he had been
eminently popular.&nbsp; All his wars had been successful.&nbsp;
He had the splendid tastes in which the English people most
delighted; . . . he had more than once been tried with
insurrection, which he had soothed down without bloodshed, and
extinguished in forgiveness . . . And it is certain that if he
had died before the divorce was mooted, Henry VIII., like the
Roman emperor said by Tacitus to have been <i>censensu omnium
dignus imperii nisi imperasset</i>, would have been considered by
posterity as formed by Providence for the conduct of the
Reformation, and his loss would have been deplored as a perpetual
calamity.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Froude has, of course, not written these words without
having facts whereby to prove them.&nbsp; One he gives in an
important note containing an extract from a letter of the
Venetian Ambassador in 1515.&nbsp; At least, if his conclusions
be correct, we must think twice ere we deny his assertion that
&lsquo;the man best able of all living Englishmen to govern
England had been set to do it by the conditions of his
birth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are bound,&rsquo; as Mr. Froude says, &lsquo;to
allow him the benefit of his past career, and be careful to
remember it in interpreting his later actions.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;The true defect in his moral constitution, that
&ldquo;intense and imperious will&rdquo; common to all princes of
the Plantagenet blood, had not yet been tested.&rsquo;&nbsp; That
he did, in his later years, act in many ways neither wisely nor
well, no one denies; that his conduct did not alienate the hearts
of his subjects is what needs explanation; and Mr. Froude&rsquo;s
opinions on this matter, novel as they are, and utterly opposed
to that of the standard modern historians, require careful
examination.&nbsp; Now I am not inclined to debate Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s character, or any other subject, as between Mr.
Froude and an author of the obscurantist or pseudo-conservative
school.&nbsp; Mr. Froude is Liberal; and so am I.&nbsp; I wish to
look at the question as between Mr. Froude and other Liberals;
and therefore, of course, first, as between Mr. Froude and Mr.
Hallam.</p>
<p>Mr. Hallam&rsquo;s name is so venerable and his work so
Important, that to set ourselves up as judges in this or in any
matter between him and Mr. Froude would be mere impertinence: but
speaking merely as learners, we have surely a right to inquire
why Mr. Hallam has entered on the whole question of Henry&rsquo;s
relations to his Parliament with a <i>pr&aelig;judicium</i>
against them; for which Mr. Froude finds no ground whatsoever in
fact.&nbsp; Why are all acts both of Henry and his Parliament to
be taken <i>in malam partem</i>?&nbsp; They were not Whigs,
certainly: neither were Socrates and Plato, nor even St. Paul and
St. John.&nbsp; They may have been honest men as men go, or they
may not: but why is there to be a feeling against them rather
than for them?&nbsp; Why is Henry always called a tyrant, and his
Parliament servile?&nbsp; The epithets have become so common and
unquestioned that our interrogation may seem startling.&nbsp;
Still we make it.&nbsp; Why was Henry a tyrant?&nbsp; That may be
true, but must be proved by facts.&nbsp; Where are they?&nbsp; Is
the mere fact of a monarch&rsquo;s asking for money a crime in
him and his ministers?&nbsp; The question would rather seem to
be, Were the moneys for which Henry asked needed or no; and, when
granted, were they rightly or wrongly applied?&nbsp; And on these
subjects we want much more information than we obtain from any
epithets.&nbsp; The author of a constitutional history should
rise above epithets: or, if he uses them, should corroborate them
by facts.&nbsp; Why should not historians be as fair and as
cautious in accusing Henry and Wolsey as they would be in
accusing Queen Victoria and Lord Palmerston?&nbsp; What right,
allow us to ask, has a grave constitutional historian to say that
&lsquo;We cannot, indeed, doubt that the unshackled and despotic
condition of his friend, Francis I., afforded a mortifying
contrast to Henry?&nbsp; What document exists in which Henry is
represented as regretting that he is the king of a free
people?&mdash;for such Mr. Hallam confesses, just above, England
was held to be, and was actually in comparison with France.&nbsp;
If the document does not exist, Mr. Hallam has surely stepped out
of the field of the historian into that of the novelist,
<i>&agrave; la</i> Scott or Dumas.&nbsp; The Parliament sometimes
grants Henry&rsquo;s demands: sometimes it refuses them, and he
has to help himself by other means.&nbsp; Why are both cases to
be interpreted <i>in malam partem</i>?&nbsp; Why is the
Parliament&rsquo;s granting to be always a proof of its
servility?&mdash;its refusing always a proof of Henry&rsquo;s
tyranny and rapacity?&nbsp; Both views are mere
<i>pr&aelig;judicia</i>, reasonable perhaps, and possible: but
why is not a <i>pr&aelig;judicium</i> of the opposite kind as
rational and as possible?&nbsp; Why has not a historian a right
to start, as Mr. Froude does, by taking for granted that both
parties may have been on the whole right; that the Parliament
granted certain sums because Henry was right in asking for them;
refused others because Henry was wrong; even that, in some cases,
Henry may have been right in asking, the Parliament wrong in
refusing; and that in such a case, under the pressure of critical
times, Henry was forced to get as he could the money which he saw
that the national cause required?&nbsp; Let it be as folks
will.&nbsp; Let Henry be sometimes right, and the Parliament
sometimes likewise; or the Parliament always right, or Henry
always right; or anything else, save this strange diseased theory
that both must have been always wrong, and that, evidence to that
effect failing, motives must be insinuated, or openly asserted,
from the writer&rsquo;s mere imagination.&nbsp; This may be a
dream: but it is as easy to imagine as the other, and more
pleasant also.&nbsp; It will probably be answered (though not by
Mr. Hallam himself) by a sneer: &lsquo;You do not seem to know
much of the world, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; But so would Figaro and Gil
Blas have said, and on exactly the same grounds.</p>
<p>Let us examine a stock instance of Henry&rsquo;s
&lsquo;rapacity&rsquo; and his Parliament&rsquo;s servility,
namely, the exactions in 1524 and 1525, and the subsequent
&lsquo;release of the King&rsquo;s debts.&rsquo;&nbsp; What are
the facts of the case?&nbsp; France and Scotland had attacked
England in 1514.&nbsp; The Scotch were beaten at Flodden.&nbsp;
The French lost Tournay and Th&eacute;rouenne, and, when peace
was made, agreed to pay the expenses of the war.&nbsp; Times
changed, and the expenses were not paid.</p>
<p>A similar war arose in 1524, and cost England immense
sums.&nbsp; A large army was maintained on the Scotch Border,
another army invaded France; and Wolsey, not venturing to call a
Parliament,&mdash;because he was, as Pope&rsquo;s legate, liable
to a <i>pr&aelig;munire</i>,&mdash;raised money by contributions
and benevolences, which were levied, it seems on the whole,
uniformly and equally (save that they weighed more heavily on the
rich than on the poor, if that be a fault), and differed from
taxes only in not having received the consent of
Parliament.&nbsp; Doubtless, this was not the best way of raising
money: but what if, under the circumstances, it were the only
one?&nbsp; What if, too, on the whole, the money so raised was
really given willingly by the nation?&nbsp; The sequel alone
could decide that.</p>
<p>The first contribution for which Wolsey asked was paid.&nbsp;
The second was resisted, and was not paid; proving thereby that
the nation need not pay unless it chose.&nbsp; The court gave
way; and the war became defensive only till 1525.</p>
<p>Then the tide turned.&nbsp; The danger, then, was not from
Francis, but from the Emperor.&nbsp; Francis was taken prisoner
at Pavia; and shortly after Rome was sacked by Bourbon.</p>
<p>The effect of all this in England is told at large in Mr.
Froude&rsquo;s second chapter.&nbsp; Henry became bond for
Francis&rsquo;s ransom, to be paid to the Emperor.&nbsp; He spent
500,000 crowns more in paying the French army; and in the terms
of peace made with France, a sum-total was agreed on for the
whole debt, old and new, to be paid as soon as possible; and an
annual pension of 500,000 crowns besides.&nbsp; The French
exchequer, however, still remained bankrupt, and again the money
was not paid.</p>
<p>Parliament, when it met in 1529, reviewed the circumstances of
the expenditure, and finding it all such as the nation on the
whole approved, legalised the taxation by benevolences
retrospectively: and this is the whole mare&rsquo;s nest of the
first payment of Henry&rsquo;s debts; if, at least, any faith is
to be put in the preamble of the Act for the release of the
King&rsquo;s Debts, 21 Hen. VIII. c. 24.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
King&rsquo;s loving subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, calling to
remembrance the inestimable costs, charges, and expenses which
the King&rsquo;s Highness hath necessarily been compelled to
support and sustain since his assumption to his crown, estate,
and dignity royal, as well for the extinction of a right
dangerous and damnable schism, sprung in the Church, as for the
modifying the insatiable and inordinate ambition of them who,
while aspiring to the monarchy of Christendom, did put universal
troubles and divisions in the same, intending, if they might, not
only to have subdued this realm, but also all the rest, unto
their power and subjection&mdash;for resistance whereof the
King&rsquo;s Highness was compelled to marvellous
charges&mdash;both for the supportation of sundry armies by sea
and land, and also for divers and manifold contribution on hand,
to save and keep his own subjects at home in rest and
repose&mdash;which hath been so politically handled that, when
the most part of all Christian lands have been infested with
cruel wars, the great Head and Prince of the world (the Pope)
brought into captivity, cities and towns taken, spoiled, burnt,
and sacked&mdash;the King&rsquo;s said subjects in all this time,
by the high providence and politic means of his Grace, have been
nevertheless preserved, defended, and maintained from all these
inconvenients, etc.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Considering, furthermore, that his Highness, in and
about the premises, hath been fain to employ not only all such
sums of money as hath risen or grown by contributions made unto
his Grace by his loving subjects&mdash;but also, over and above
the same, sundry other notable and excellent sums of his own
treasure and yearly revenues, among which manifold great sums so
employed, his Highness also, as is notoriously known, and as doth
evidently appear by the <span class="GutSmall">ACCOUNTS OF THE
SAME</span>, hath to that use, and none other, converted all such
money as by any of his subjects hath been advanced to his Grace
by way of prest or loan, either particularly, or by any taxation
made of the same&mdash;being things so well collocate and
bestowed, seeing the said high and great fruits and effects
thereof insured to the surety and commodity and tranquillity of
this realm&mdash;of our mind and consent, do freely, absolutely,
give and grant to the King&rsquo;s Highness all and every sum or
sums of money,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>The second release of the King&rsquo;s debts, in 1544, is very
similar.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s debts and necessities were
really, when we come to examine them, those of the nation: in
1538&ndash;40 England was put into a thorough state of defence
from end to end.&nbsp; Fortresses were built along the Scottish
Border, and all along the coast opposite France and
Flanders.&nbsp; The people were drilled and armed, the fleet
equipped; and the nation, for the time, became one great
army.&nbsp; And nothing but this, as may be proved by an
overwhelming mass of evidence, saved the country from
invasion.&nbsp; Here were enormous necessary expenses which must
be met.</p>
<p>In 1543 a million crowns were to have been paid by Francis the
First as part of his old debt.&nbsp; It was not paid: but, on the
contrary, Henry had to go to war for it.&nbsp; The nation again
relinquished their claim, and allowed Henry to raise another
benevolence in 1545, concerning which Mr. Hallam tells us a great
deal, but not one word of the political circumstances which led
to it or to the release, keeping his sympathies and his paper for
the sorrows of refractory Alderman Reed, who, refusing (alone of
all the citizens) to contribute to the support of troops on the
Scotch Border or elsewhere, was sent down, by a sort of rough
justice, to serve on the Scotch Border himself, and judge of the
&lsquo;perils of the nation&rsquo; with his own eyes; and
being&mdash;one is pleased to hear&mdash;taken prisoner by the
Scots, had to pay a great deal more as ransom than he would have
paid as benevolence.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; What proof is there, in all this, of that
servility which most historians, and Mr. Hallam among the rest,
are wont to attribute to Henry&rsquo;s Parliaments?&nbsp; What
feeling appears on the face of this document, which we have given
and quoted, but one honourable to the nation?&nbsp; Through the
falsehood of a foreign nation the King is unable to perform his
engagements to the people.&nbsp; Is not the just and generous
course in such a case to release him from those
engagements?&nbsp; Does this preamble, does a single fact of the
case, justify historians in talking of these &lsquo;king&rsquo;s
debts&rsquo; in just the same tone as that in which they would
have spoken if the King had squandered the money on private
pleasures?&nbsp; Perhaps most people who write small histories
believe that this really was the case.&nbsp; They certainly would
gather no other impression from the pages of Mr. Hallam.&nbsp; No
doubt the act must have been burdensome on some people.&nbsp;
Many, we are told, had bequeathed their promissory notes to their
children, used their reversionary interest in the loan in many
ways; and these, of course, felt the change very heavily.&nbsp;
No doubt: but why have we not a right to suppose that the
Parliament were aware of that fact; but chose it as the less of
the two evils?&nbsp; The King had spent the money; he was unable
to recover it from Francis; could only refund it by raising some
fresh tax or benevolence: and why may not the Parliament have
considered the release of old taxes likely to offend fewer people
than the imposition of new ones?&nbsp; It is certainly an ugly
thing to break public faith; but to prove that public faith was
broken, we must prove that Henry compelled the Parliament to
release him; if the act was of their own free will, no public
faith was broken, for they were the representatives of the
nation, and through them the nation forgave its own debt.&nbsp;
And what evidence have we that they did not represent the nation,
and that, on the whole, we must suppose, as we should in the case
of any other men, that they best knew their own business?&nbsp;
May we not apply to this case, and to others, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, the argument which Mr. Froude uses so boldly and
well in the case of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s trial&mdash;&lsquo;The
English nation also, as well as . . . deserves justice at our
hands?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Certainly it does: but it is a disagreeable token of the
method on which we have been accustomed to write the history of
our own forefathers, that Mr. Froude should find it necessary to
state formally so very simple a truth.</p>
<p>What proof, we ask again, is there that this old Parliament
was &lsquo;servile&rsquo;?&nbsp; Had that been so, Wolsey would
not have been afraid to summon it.&nbsp; The specific reason for
not summoning a Parliament for six years after that of 1524 was
that they were not servile; that when (here we are quoting Mr.
Hallam, and not Mr. Froude) Wolsey entered the House of Commons
with a great train, seemingly for the purpose of intimidation,
they &lsquo;made no other answer to his harangues than that it
was their usage to debate only among themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
debates on this occasion lasted fifteen or sixteen days, during
which, says an eye-witness, &lsquo;there has been the greatest
and sorest hold in the Lower House,&rsquo; &lsquo;the matter
debated and beaten&rsquo;; &lsquo;such hold that the House was
like to have been dissevered&rsquo;; in a word, hard
fighting&mdash;and why not honest fighting?&mdash;between the
court party and the Opposition, &lsquo;which ended,&rsquo; says
Mr. Hallam, &lsquo;in the court party obtaining, with the utmost
difficulty, a grant much inferior to the Cardinal&rsquo;s
original requisition.&rsquo;&nbsp; What token of servility is
here?</p>
<p>And is it reasonable to suppose that after Wolsey was
conquered, and a comparatively popular ministry had succeeded,
and that memorable Parliament of 1529 (which Mr. Froude, not
unjustly, thinks more memorable than the Long Parliament itself)
began its great work with a high hand, backed not merely by the
King, but by the public opinion of the majority of England, their
decisions are likely to have been more servile than before?&nbsp;
If they resisted the King when they disagreed with him, are they
to be accused of servility because they worked with him when they
agreed with him?&nbsp; Is an Opposition always in the right; a
ministerial party always in the wrong?&nbsp; Is it an offence
against the people to agree with the monarch, even when he agrees
with the people himself?&nbsp; Simple as these questions are, one
must really stop to ask them.</p>
<p>No doubt pains were often taken to secure elections favourable
to the Government.&nbsp; Are none taken now?&nbsp; Are not more
taken now?&nbsp; Will any historian show us the documents which
prove the existence, in the sixteenth century, of Reform Club,
Carlton Club, whippers-in and nominees, governmental and
opposition, and all the rest of the beautiful machinery which
protects our Reformed Parliament from the evil influences of
bribery and corruption?&nbsp; Pah!&mdash;We have somewhat too
much glass in our modern House to afford to throw stones at our
forefathers&rsquo; old St. Stephen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At the worst,
what was done then but that without which it is said to be
impossible to carry on a Government now?&nbsp; Take an instance
from the Parliament of 1539, one in which there is no doubt
Government influence was used in order to prevent as much as
possible the return of members favourable to the clergy&mdash;for
the good reason that the clergy were no doubt, on their own side,
intimidating voters by all those terrors of the unseen world
which had so long been to them a source of boundless profit and
power.</p>
<p>Cromwell writes to the King to say that he has secured a seat
for a certain Sir Richard Morrison; but for what purpose?&nbsp;
As one who no doubt &lsquo;should be ready to answer and take up
such as should crack or face with literature of learning, if any
such should be.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was, then, free discussion;
they expected clever and learned speakers in the Opposition, and
on subjects of the deepest import, not merely political, but
spiritual; and the Government needed men to answer such.&nbsp;
What more natural than that so close on the &lsquo;Pilgrimage of
Grace,&rsquo; and in the midst of so great dangers at home and
abroad, the Government should have done their best to secure a
well-disposed House (one would like to know when they would
not)?&nbsp; But surely the very effort (confessedly exceptional)
and the acknowledged difficulty prove that Parliament were no
mere &lsquo;registrars of edicts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the strongest argument against the tyranny of the Tudors,
and especially of Henry VIII. in his &lsquo;benevolences,&rsquo;
is derived from the state of the people themselves.&nbsp; If
these benevolences had been really unpopular, they would not have
been paid.&nbsp; In one case we have seen, a benevolence was not
paid for that very reason.&nbsp; For the method of the Tudor
sovereigns, like that of their predecessors, was the very
opposite to that of tyrants in every age and country.&nbsp; The
first act of a tyrant has always been to disarm the people, and
to surround himself with a standing army.&nbsp; The Tudor method
was, as Mr. Froude shows us by many interesting facts, to keep
the people armed and drilled, even to compel them to learn the
use of weapons.&nbsp; Throughout England spread one vast military
organisation, which made every adult a soldier, and enabled him
to find, at a day&rsquo;s notice, his commanding officer, whether
landlord, sheriff, or lieutenant of the county; so that, as a
foreign ambassador of the time remarks with astonishment (we
quote from memory), &lsquo;England is the strongest nation on
earth, for though the King has not a single mercenary soldier, he
can raise in three days an army of two hundred thousand
men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And of what temper those men were it is well known
enough.&nbsp; Mr. Froude calls them&mdash;and we beg leave to
endorse, without exception, Mr. Froude&rsquo;s
opinion&mdash;&lsquo;A sturdy high-hearted race, sound in body
and fierce in spirit, and furnished with thews and sinews which,
under the stimulus of those &ldquo;great shins of beef,&rdquo;
their common diet, were the wonder of the age.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;What comyn folke in all this world,&rsquo; says a State
Paper in 1515, &lsquo;may compare with the comyns of England in
riches, freedom, liberty, welfare, and all prosperity?&nbsp; What
comyn folk is so mighty, so strong in the felde, as the comyns of
England?&rsquo;&nbsp; In authentic stories of actions under Henry
VIII.&mdash;and, we will add, under Elizabeth
likewise&mdash;where the accuracy of the account is undeniable,
no disparity of force made Englishmen shrink from enemies
whenever they could meet them.&nbsp; Again and again a few
thousands of them carried dismay into the heart of France.&nbsp;
Four hundred adventurers, vagabond apprentices of London, who
formed a volunteer corps in the Calais garrison, were for years,
Hall says, the terror of Normandy.&nbsp; In the very frolic of
conscious power they fought and plundered without pay, without
reward, save what they could win for themselves; and when they
fell at last, they fell only when surrounded by six times their
number, and were cut to pieces in careless desperation.&nbsp;
Invariably, by friend and foe alike, the English are described as
the fiercest people in all Europe&mdash;English wild beasts
Benvenuto Cellini calls them; and this great physical power they
owed to the profuse abundance in which they lived, to the
soldier&rsquo;s training in which every one of them was bred from
childhood.</p>
<p>Mr. Froude&rsquo;s novel assertion about profuse abundance
must be weighed by those who have read his invaluable
introductory chapter.&nbsp; But we must ask at once how it was
possible to levy on such an armed populace a tax which they were
determined not to pay, and felt that they were not bound to pay,
either in law or justice?&nbsp; Conceive Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s
sending down to demand a &lsquo;benevolence&rsquo; from the army
at Aldershot, beginning with the general in command and
descending to the privates . . . What would be the
consequences?&nbsp; Ugly enough: but gentle in comparison with
those of any attempt to exact a really unpopular tax from a
nation of well-armed Englishmen, unless they, on the whole,
thought the tax fit to be paid.&nbsp; They would grumble, of
course, whether they intended to pay or not,&mdash;for were they
not Englishmen, our own flesh and blood?&mdash;and grumble all
the more in person, because they had no Press to grumble for
them: but what is there then in the M.P.&rsquo;s letter to Lord
Surrey, quoted by Mr. Hallam, p. 25, or in the more pointed
letter of Warham&rsquo;s, two pages on, which we do not see lying
on our breakfast tables in half the newspapers every week?&nbsp;
Poor, pedantic, obstructive old Warham, himself very angry at so
much being asked of his brother clergymen, and at their being
sworn as to the value of their goods (so like are old times to
new ones); and being, on the whole, of opinion that the world
(the Church included) is going to the devil, says that as he has
been &lsquo;showed in a secret manner of his friends, the people
sore grudgeth and murmureth, and speaketh cursedly among
themselves, as far as they dare, saying they shall never have
rest of payments as long as some liveth, and that they had better
die than thus be continually handed, reckoning themselves, their
wives and children, as despoulit, and not greatly caring what
they do, or what becomes of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Very dreadful&mdash;if true: which last point depends very
much upon who Warham was.&nbsp; Now, on reading Mr.
Froude&rsquo;s or any other good history, we shall find that
Warham was one of the leaders of that despondent party which will
always have its antitype in England.&nbsp; Have we, too, not
heard within the last seven years similar prophecies of
desolation, mourning, and woe&mdash;of the Church tottering on
the verge of ruin, the peasantry starving under the horrors of
free trade, noble families reduced to the verge of beggary by
double income-tax?&nbsp; Even such a prophet seems Warham to have
been&mdash;of all people in that day, one of the last whom one
would have asked for an opinion.</p>
<p>Poor old Warham, however, was not so far wrong in this
particular case; for the &lsquo;despoulit&rsquo; slaves of
Suffolk, not content with grumbling, rose up with sword and bow,
and vowed that they would not pay.&nbsp; Whereon the bloated
tyrant sent his pr&aelig;torians, and enforced payment by scourge
and thumbscrew?&nbsp; Not in the least.&nbsp; They would not pay;
and therefore, being free men, nobody could make them pay; and
although in the neighbouring county of Norfolk, from twenty
pounds (<i>i.e.</i> &pound;200 of our money) upward&mdash;for the
tax was not levied on men of less substance&mdash;there were not
twenty but what had consented; and though there was &lsquo;great
likelihood that this grant should be much more than the loan
was&rsquo; (the &lsquo;salt tears&rsquo; shed by the gentlemen of
Norfolk proceeding, says expressly the Duke of Norfolk,
&lsquo;only from doubt how to find money to content the
King&rsquo;s Highness&rsquo;); yet the King and Wolsey gave way
frankly and at once, and the contribution was remitted, although
the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, writing to Wolsey, treat the
insurrection lightly, and seem to object to the remission as
needless.</p>
<p>From all which facts&mdash;they are Mr. Hallam&rsquo;s, not
Mr. Froude&rsquo;s&mdash;we can deduce not tyranny, but lenity,
good sense, and the frank withdrawal from a wrong position as
soon as the unwillingness of the people proved it to be a wrong
one.</p>
<p>This instance is well brought forward (though only in a line
or two, by Mr. Froude) as one among many proofs that the working
classes in Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s time &lsquo;enjoyed an
abundance far beyond that which in general falls to the lot of
that order in long-settled countries, incomparably beyond what
the same class were enjoying at that very time in Germany or
France.&nbsp; The laws secured them; and that the laws were put
in force, we have the direct evidence of successive acts of the
Legislature, justifying the general policy by its success: and we
have also the indirect evidence of the contented loyalty of the
great body of the people, at a time when, if they had been
discontented, they held in their own hands the means of asserting
what the law acknowledged to be their right.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Government,&rsquo; as we have just shown at length, &lsquo;had no
power to compel injustice . . . If the peasantry had been
suffering under any real grievances we should have heard of them
when the religious rebellions furnished so fair an opportunity to
press them forward.&nbsp; Complaint was loud enough, when
complaint was just, under the Somerset Protectorate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such broad facts as these&mdash;for facts they are&mdash;ought
to make us pause ere we boast of the greater liberty enjoyed by
Englishmen of the present day, as compared with the tyranny of
Tudor times.&nbsp; Thank God, there is no lack of that blessing
now: but was there any real lack of it then?&nbsp; Certainly the
outward notes of a tyranny exist now in far greater completeness
than then.&nbsp; A standing army, a Government police, ministries
who bear no love to a militia, and would consider the compulsory
arming and drilling of the people as a dangerous insanity, do not
look at first sight as much like &lsquo;free institutions&rsquo;
as a Government which, though again and again in danger not
merely of rebellion, but of internecine wars of succession, so
trusted the people as to force weapons into their hands from
boyhood.&nbsp; Let us not be mistaken: we are no hankerers after
retrogression: the present system works very well; let it be; all
that we say is that the imputation of despotic institutions lies,
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i>, rather against the reign of Queen
Victoria than against that of King Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; Of
course it is not so in fact.&nbsp; Many modern methods, which are
despotic in appearance, are not so in practice.&nbsp; Let us
believe that the same was the case in the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; Our governors now understand their own business
best, and make a very fair compromise between discipline and
freedom.&nbsp; Let us believe that the men of the sixteenth
century did so likewise.&nbsp; All we ask is that our forefathers
should be judged as we wish to be judged ourselves, &lsquo;not
according to outward appearance, but with righteous
judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Froude finds the cause of this general contentment and
loyalty of the masses in the extreme care which the Government
took of their well-being.&nbsp; The introductory chapter, in
which he proves to his own satisfaction the correctness of his
opinion, is well worth the study of our political
economists.&nbsp; The facts which he brings seem certainly
overwhelming; of course, they can only be met by counter-facts;
and our knowledge does not enable us either to corroborate or
refute his statements.&nbsp; The chief argument used against them
seems to us, at least, to show that for some cause or other the
working classes were prosperous enough.&nbsp; It is said the Acts
of Parliament regulating wages do not fix the minimum of wages,
but the maximum.&nbsp; They are not intended to defend the
employed against the employer, but the employer against the
employed, in a defective state of the labour market, when the
workmen, by the fewness of their numbers, were enabled to make
extravagant demands.&nbsp; Let this be the case&mdash;we do not
say that it is so&mdash;what is it but a token of prosperity
among the working classes?&nbsp; A labour market so thin that
workmen can demand their own price for their labour, till
Parliament is compelled to bring them to reason, is surely a time
of prosperity to the employed&mdash;a time of full work and high
wages; of full stomachs, inclined from very prosperity to
&lsquo;wax fat and kick.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, however, any learned
statistician should be able to advance, on the opposite side of
the question, enough to weaken some of Mr. Froude&rsquo;s
conclusions, he must still, if he be a just man, do honour to the
noble morality of this most striking chapter, couched as it is in
as perfect English as we have ever had the delight of
reading.&nbsp; We shall leave, then, the battle of facts to be
fought out by statisticians, always asking Mr. Froude&rsquo;s
readers to bear in mind that, though other facts may be true, yet
his facts are no less true likewise; and we shall quote at
length, both as a specimen of his manner and of his matter, the
last three pages of this introductory chapter, in which, after
speaking of the severity of the laws against vagrancy, and
showing how they were excused by the organisation which found
employment for every able-bodied man, he goes on to
say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It was therefore the expressed conviction
of the English nation that it was better for a man not to live at
all than to live a profitless and worthless life.&nbsp; The
vagabond was a sore spot upon the commonwealth, to be healed by
wholesale discipline if the gangrene was not incurable; to be cut
away with the knife if the milder treatment of the cart-whip
failed to be of profit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A measure so extreme in its severity was partly
dictated by policy.&nbsp; The state of the country was critical;
and the danger from questionable persons traversing it,
unexamined and uncontrolled, was greater than at ordinary
times.&nbsp; But in point of justice as well as of prudence it
harmonised with the iron temper of the age, and it answered well
for the government of a fierce and powerful people, in whose
hearts lay an intense hatred of rascality, and among whom no one
could have lapsed into evil courses except by deliberate
preference for them.&nbsp; The moral sinew of the English must
have been strong indeed when it admitted of such stringent
bracing; but, on the whole, they were ruled as they preferred to
be ruled; and if wisdom can be tested by success, the manner in
which they passed the great crisis of the Reformation is the best
justification of their princes.&nbsp; The era was great
throughout Europe.&nbsp; The Italians of the age of Michael
Angelo, the Spaniards who were the contemporaries of Cortez, the
Germans who shook off the Pope at the call of Luther, and the
splendid chivalry of Francis I. of France, were no common
men.&nbsp; But they were all brought face to face with the same
trials, and none met them as the English met them.&nbsp; The
English alone never lost their self-possession, and if they owed
something to fortune in their escape from anarchy, they owed more
to the strong hand and steady purpose of their rulers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To conclude this chapter, then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the brief review of the system under which England
was governed, we have seen a state of things in which the
principles of political economy were, consciously or
unconsciously, contradicted; where an attempt, more or less
successful, was made to bring the production and distribution of
wealth under the moral rule of right or wrong; and where those
laws of supply and demand, which we are now taught to regard as
immutable ordinances of nature, were absorbed or superseded by a
higher code.&nbsp; It is necessary for me to repeat that I am not
holding up the sixteenth century as a model which the nineteenth
might safely follow.&nbsp; The population has become too large,
and employment too complicated and fluctuating, to admit of such
control; while, in default of control, the relapse upon
self-interest as the one motive principle is certain to ensue,
and, when it ensues, is absolute in its operations.&nbsp; But as,
even with us, these so-called ordinances of nature in time of war
consent to be suspended, and duty to his country becomes with
every good citizen a higher motive of action than the advantages
which he may gain in an enemy&rsquo;s market; so it is not
uncheering to look back upon a time when the nation was in a
normal condition of militancy against social injustice&mdash;when
the Government was enabled, by happy circumstances, to pursue
into detail a single and serious aim at the
well-being&mdash;well-being in its widest sense&mdash;of all
members of the commonwealth.&nbsp; There were difficulties and
drawbacks at that time as well as this.&nbsp; Of Liberty, in the
modern sense of the word&mdash;of the supposed right of every man
&ldquo;to do what he will with his own,&rdquo; or with
himself&mdash;there was no idea.&nbsp; To the question, if ever
it was asked, &ldquo;May I not do what I will with my own?&rdquo;
there was the brief answer, &ldquo;No man may do what is wrong,
either with what is his own or with what is
another&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Producers, too, who were not
permitted to drive down their workmen&rsquo;s wages by
competition, could not sell their goods as cheaply as they might
have done, and the consumer paid for the law in an advance of
price; but the burden, though it fell heavily on the rich,
lightly touched the poor and the rich consented cheerfully to a
tax which ensured the loyalty of the people.&nbsp; The working
man of modern times has bought the extension of his liberty at
the price of his material comfort.&nbsp; The higher classes have
gained in wealth what they have lost in power.&nbsp; It is not
for the historian to balance advantages.&nbsp; His duty is with
the facts.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our forefathers, then, were not free, if we attach to that
word the meaning which our Transatlantic brothers seem inclined
to give to it.&nbsp; They had not learnt to deify self-will, and
to claim for each member of the human race a right to the
indulgence of every eccentricity.&nbsp; They called themselves
free, and boasted of their freedom; but their conception of
liberty was that of all old nations, a freedom which not only
allowed of discipline, but which grew out of it.&nbsp; No people
had less wish to exalt the kingly power into that specious
tyranny, a paternal Government; the king was with them, and
always had been, both formally and really, subject to their
choice; bound by many oaths to many duties; the minister, not the
master of the people.&nbsp; But their whole conception of
political life was, nevertheless, shaped by their conception of
family life.&nbsp; Strict obedience, stern discipline, compulsory
education in practical duties, was the law of the latter; without
such training they thought their sons could never become in any
true sense men.&nbsp; And when they grew up, their civic life was
to be conducted on the same principles, for the very purpose of
enabling them to live as members of a free nation.&nbsp; If the
self-will of the individual was curbed, now and then,
needlessly&mdash;as it is the nature of all human methods to
caricature themselves at times&mdash;the purpose was, not to
weaken the man, but to strengthen him by strengthening the body
to which he belonged.&nbsp; The nation was to be free,
self-helping, self-containing, unconquerable; to that great
purpose the will, the fancy&mdash;even, if need be, the mortal
life of the individual, must give way.&nbsp; Men must be trained
at all costs in self-restraint, because only so could they become
heroes in the day of danger; in self-sacrifice for the common
good, because only so would they remain united, while foreign
nations and evil home influences were trying to tear them
asunder.&nbsp; In a word, their conception of life was as a
warfare; their organisation that of a regiment.&nbsp; It is a
question whether the conception of corporate life embodied in a
regiment or army be not, after all, the best working one for this
world.&nbsp; At least the problem of a perfect society, howsoever
beautiful on paper, will always issue in a compromise, more or
less perfect&mdash;let us hope more and more perfect as the
centuries roll on&mdash;between the strictness of military
discipline and the Irishman&rsquo;s <i>laissez-faire</i> ideal,
wherein &lsquo;every man should do that which was right in the
sight of his own eyes, and wrong too, if he liked.&rsquo;&nbsp;
At least, such had England been for centuries; under such a
system had she thriven; a fact which, duly considered, should
silence somewhat those gentlemen who, not being of a military
turn themselves, inform Europe so patriotically and so prudently
that &lsquo;England is not a military nation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From this dogma we beg leave to differ utterly.&nbsp; Britain
is at this moment, in our eyes, the only military nation in
Europe.&nbsp; All other nations seem to us to have military
governments, but not to be military themselves.&nbsp; As proof of
the assertion, we appeal merely to the existence of our
militia.&nbsp; While other nations are employing conscription, we
have raised in twelve months a noble army, every soul of which
has volunteered as a free man; and yet, forsooth, we are not a
military nation!&nbsp; We are not ashamed to tell how, but the
other day, standing in the rear of those militia regiments, no
matter where, a flush of pride came over us at the sight of those
lads, but a few months since helpless and awkward country boors,
now full of sturdy intelligence, cheerful obedience, and the
manhood which can afford to be respectful to others, because it
respects itself, and knows that it is respected in turn.&nbsp;
True, they had not the lightness, the order, the practical ease,
the cunning self-helpfulness of the splendid German legionaries
who stood beside them, the breast of every other private
decorated with clasps and medals for service in the wars of seven
years since.&nbsp; As an invading body, perhaps, one would have
preferred the Germans; but only because experience had taught
them already what it would teach in twelve months to the
Berkshire or Cambridge &lsquo;clod.&rsquo;&nbsp; There, to us,
was the true test of England&rsquo;s military qualities; her
young men had come by tens of thousands, of their own free will,
to be made soldiers of by her country gentlemen, and treated by
them the while as men to be educated, not as things to be
compelled; not driven like sheep to the slaughter, to be
disciplined by men with whom they had no bond but the mere
official one of military obedience; and &lsquo;What,&rsquo; we
ask ourselves, &lsquo;does England lack to make her a second
Rome?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her people have physical strength, animal
courage, that self-dependence of freemen which enabled at
Inkerman the privates to fight on literally without officers,
every man for his own hand.&nbsp; She has inventive genius,
enormous wealth; and if, as is said, her soldiers lack at present
the self-helpfulness of the Zouave, it is ridiculous to suppose
that that quality could long be wanting in the men of a nation
which is at this moment the foremost in the work of emigration
and colonisation.&nbsp; If organising power and military system
be, as is said, lacking in high quarters, surely there must be
organising power enough somewhere in the greatest industrial
nation upon earth, ready to come forward when there is a real
demand for it; and whatever be the defects of our system, we are
surely not as far behind Prussia or France as Rome was behind the
Carthaginians and the Greeks whom she crushed.&nbsp; A few years
sufficed for them to learn all they needed from their enemies;
fewer still would suffice us to learn from our friends.&nbsp; Our
working classes are not, like those of America, in a state of
physical comfort too great to make it worth while for them to
leave their home occupations; and whether that be a good or an
evil, it at least ensures us, as our militia proves, an almost
inexhaustible supply of volunteers.&nbsp; What a new and awful
scene for the world&rsquo;s drama, did such a nation as this once
set before itself, steadily and ruthlessly, as Rome did of old,
the idea of conquest.&nbsp; Even now, waging war as she has done,
as it were, &#7952;&nu;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&rho;&gamma;&#8119;, thinking war too
unimportant a part of her work to employ on it her highest
intellects, her flag has advanced in the last fifty years over
more vast and richer tracts than that of any European nation upon
earth.&nbsp; What keeps her from the dream which lured to their
destruction Babylon, Macedonia, Rome?</p>
<p>This: that, thank God, she has a conscience still; that,
feeling intensely the sacredness of her own national life, she
has learned to look on that of other people&rsquo;s as sacred
also; and since, in the fifteenth century, she finally repented
of that wild and unrighteous dream of conquering France, she has
discovered more and more that true military greatness lies in the
power of defence, and not of attack; not in waging war, but being
able to wage it; and has gone on her true mission of replenishing
the earth more peacefully, on the whole, and more humanely, than
did ever nation before her; conquering only when it was necessary
to put down the lawlessness of the savage few for the well-being
of the civilised many.&nbsp; This has been her idea; she may have
confused it and herself in Caffre or in Chinese wars; for who can
always be true to the light within him?&nbsp; But this has been
her idea; and therefore she stands and grows and thrives, a
virgin land for now eight hundred years.</p>
<p>But a fancy has come over us during the last blessed forty
years of unexampled peace, from which our ancestors of the
sixteenth century were kept by stern and yet most wholesome
lessons; the fancy that peace, and not war, is the normal
condition of the world.&nbsp; The fancy is so fair that we blame
none who cherish it; after all they do good by cherishing it;
they point us to an ideal which we should otherwise forget, as
Babylon, Rome, France in the seventeenth century, forgot
utterly.&nbsp; Only they are in haste (and pardonable haste too)
to realise that ideal, forgetting that to do so would be really
to stop short of it, and to rest contented in some form of human
society far lower than that which God has actually prepared for
those who love Him.&nbsp; Better to believe that all our
conceptions of the height to which the human race might attain
are poor and paltry compared with that toward which God is
guiding it, and for which he is disciplining it by awful lessons:
and to fight on, if need be, ruthless, and yet full of
pity&mdash;and many a noble soul has learnt within the last two
years how easy it is to reconcile in practice that seeming
paradox of words&mdash;smiting down stoutly evil wheresoever we
shall find it, and saying, &lsquo;What ought to be, we know not;
God alone can know: but that this ought not to be, we do know,
and here, in God&rsquo;s name, it shall not stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We repeat it: war, in some shape or other, is the normal
condition of the world.&nbsp; It is a fearful fact: but we shall
not abolish it by ignoring it, and ignoring by the same method
the teaching of our Bibles.&nbsp; Not in mere metaphor does the
gospel of Love describe the life of the individual good man as a
perpetual warfare.&nbsp; Not in mere metaphor does the apostle of
Love see in his visions of the world&rsquo;s future no Arcadian
shepherd paradises, not even a perfect civilisation, but an
eternal war in heaven, wrath and woe, plague and earthquake; and
amid the everlasting storm, the voices of the saints beneath the
altar crying, &lsquo;Lord, how long?&rsquo;&nbsp; Shall we
pretend to have more tender hearts than the old man of Ephesus,
whose dying sermon, so old legends say, was nought
but&mdash;&lsquo;Little children, love one another&rsquo;; and
who yet could denounce the liar and the hater and the covetous
man, and proclaim the vengeance of God against all evildoers,
with all the fierceness of an Isaiah?&nbsp; It was enough for
him&mdash;let it be enough for us&mdash;that he should see, above
the thunder-cloud, and the rain of blood, and the scorpion swarm,
and the great angel calling all the fowl of heaven to the supper
of the great God, that they might eat the flesh of kings and
valiant men, a city of God eternal in the heavens, and yet
eternally descending among men; a perfect order, justice, love,
and peace, becoming actual more and more in every age, through
all the fearful training needful for a fallen race.</p>
<p>Let that be enough for us: but do not let us fancy that what
is true of the two extremes must not needs be true of the mean
also; that while the life of the individual and of the universe
is one of perpetual self-defence, the life of the nation can be
aught else: or that any appliances of scientific comforts, any
intellectual cultivation, even any of the most direct and
common-sense arguments of self-interest, can avail to quiet in
man those outbursts of wrath, ambition, cupidity, wounded pride,
which have periodically convulsed, and will convulse to the end,
the human race.&nbsp; The philosopher in his study may prove
their absurdity, their suicidal folly, till, deluded by the
strange lull of a forty years&rsquo; peace, he may look on wars
as in the same category with flagellantisms, witch-manias, and
other &lsquo;popular delusions,&rsquo; as insanities of the past,
impossible henceforth; and may prophesy, as really wise political
economists were doing in 1847, that mankind had grown too
sensible to go to war any more.&nbsp; And behold, the peace
proves only to be the lull before the thunderstorm; and one
electric shock sets free forces unsuspected, transcendental,
supernatural in the deepest sense; forces which we can no more
stop, by shrieks at their absurdity, from incarnating themselves
in actual blood, and misery, and horror, than we can control the
madman in his paroxysm by telling him that he is a madman.&nbsp;
And so the fair vision of the student is buried once more in rack
and hail and driving storm; and, like Daniel of old when
rejoicing over the coming restoration of his people, he sees
beyond the victory some darker struggle still, and lets his notes
of triumph die away into a wail,&mdash;&lsquo;And the end thereof
shall be with a flood; and to the end of the war desolations are
determined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is as impossible as it would be unwise to conceal from
ourselves the fact that all the Continental nations look upon our
present peace as but transitory, momentary; and on the Crimean
war as but the prologue to a fearful drama&mdash;all the more
fearful because none knows its purpose, its plot, which character
will be assumed by any given actor, and, least of all, the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the whole.&nbsp; All that they feel
and know is that everything which has happened since 1848 has
exasperated, not calmed, the electric tension of the European
atmosphere; that a rottenness, rapidly growing intolerable alike
&lsquo;to God and the enemies of God,&rsquo; has eaten into the
vitals of Continental life; that their rulers know neither where
they are nor whither they are going, and only pray that things
may last out their time: all notes which one would interpret as
proving the Continent to be already ripe for subjection to some
one devouring race of conquerors, were there not a ray of hope in
an expectation, even more painful to our human pity, which is
held by some of the wisest among the Germans; namely, that the
coming war will fast resolve into no struggle between bankrupt
monarchs and their respective armies, but a war between nations
themselves, an internecine war of opinions and of creeds.&nbsp;
There are wise Germans now who prophesy, with sacred tears, a
second &lsquo;Thirty Years&rsquo; War,&rsquo; with all its
frantic horrors, for their hapless country, which has found two
centuries too short a time wherein to recover from the exhaustion
of that first fearful scourge.&nbsp; Let us trust, if that war
shall beget its new Tillys and Wallensteins, it shall also beget
its new Gustavus Adolphus, and many another child of Light: but
let us not hope that we can stand by in idle comfort, and that
when the overflowing scourge passes by it shall not reach to
us.&nbsp; Shame to us, were that our destiny!&nbsp; Shame to us,
were we to refuse our share in the struggles of the human race,
and to stand by in idle comfort while the Lord&rsquo;s battles
are being fought.&nbsp; Honour to us, if in that day we have
chosen for our leaders, as our forefathers of the sixteenth
century did, men who see the work which God would have them do,
and have hearts and heads to do it.&nbsp; Honour to us, if we
spend this transient lull, as our forefathers of the sixteenth
century did, in setting our house in order, in redressing every
grievance, reforming every abuse, knitting the hearts of the
British nation together by practical care and help between class
and class, man and man, governor and governed, that we may
bequeath to our children, as Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s men did to
theirs, a British national life, so united and whole-hearted, so
clear in purpose and sturdy in execution, so trained to know the
right side at the first glance and take it, that they shall look
back with love and honour upon us, their fathers, determined to
carry out, even to the death, the method which we have bequeathed
to them.&nbsp; Then, if God will that the powers of evil,
physical and spiritual, should combine against this land, as they
did in the days of good Queen Bess, we shall not have lived in
vain; for those who, as in Queen Bess&rsquo;s days, thought to
yoke for their own use a labouring ox, will find, as then, that
they have roused a lion from his den.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
